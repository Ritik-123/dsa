Search Algorithms:

Linear Search:

    Linear Search Pseudocode : 

    . Create function with two parameters which are an array and a value.
    . Loop through the array and check if the current array element is equal to the value.
    . If it is return the index which the element is found.
    . if the value is never found return -1.

    When to use:

        . When given array is unsorted.

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)


Binary Search:

    . Much more faster than linear search.
    . Half of the remaining elements can be eliminated at a time, instead of eliminated them one by one.
    . It only works for sorted arrays

    Binary Search Pseudocode:

        . Create function with two parameters which are sorted array and a value.
        . Create two pointers: a left pointer at the start of the array and the right pointer at the end of array.
        . Based on left and right pointers calculate the middle pointer.
        . While middle is not equal to the value and start <= end loop:
            . If the middle is greater than the value move the right pointer down.
            . If the middle is less than the value move the left pointer up.
        . If the value is never found return -1.

    Time Complexity:
        
        . Worst Case: O(logn)
        . Best Case: O(1) 

    Space Complexity: O(1)
