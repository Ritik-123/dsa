These are 7 operations that is performed by queue.
    1. Createqueue
    2. Enqueue
    3. Dequeue
    4. Peek   : return 1st element of queue without removing it.
    5. isEmpty
    6. isFull : Not used in LinkedList.
    7. isDelete

-> If we use List with capacity then it will become circular queue.
-> without using capacity limit in a list then it will be very slow.

#-------------Circular Queue------------------

- Used when we have limit in python list but we are facing issues index in inserting element.
For example a= [1,2,3] : it's size limit is 3.
    - when we delete first element then after we insert index value will be change.
